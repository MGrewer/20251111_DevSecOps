    "Welcome to Notebook 1 of the Vibe Coding with Databricks Assistant Lab. Throughout this lab tutorial our goal will be to build a Demand Sensing engine using the power of Databricks! In this session, you will explore the chat functionality of the Databricks Assistant. You will use the Assistant to ask questions, write code, and debug individual cells as you build an ETL pipeline for a demand sensing demo. This hands-on lab will help you become familiar with interactive coding and troubleshooting in Databricks notebooks, leveraging the power of AI to accelerate your workflow.\n",
